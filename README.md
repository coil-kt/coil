![Coil](logo.svg)

An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines. Coil is:

- **Fast**: Coil performs a number of optimizations including memory and disk caching, downsampling the image in memory, re-using Bitmaps, automatically pausing/cancelling requests, and more.
- **Lightweight**: Coil adds ~1500 methods to your APK (for apps that already use OkHttp and Coroutines), which is comparable to Picasso and significantly less than Glide and Fresco.
- **Easy to use**: Coil's API leverages Kotlin's language features for simplicity and minimal boilerplate.
- **Modern**: Coil is Kotlin-first and uses modern libraries including Coroutines, OkHttp, Okio, and AndroidX Lifecycles.

Coil is an acronym for: **Co**routine **I**mage **L**oader.

## Download

Coil is available on `mavenCentral()`.

```kotlin
implementation("io.coil-kt:coil:0.9.5")
```

## Quick Start

To load an image into an `ImageView`, use the `load` extension function:

```kotlin
// URL
imageView.load("https://www.example.com/image.jpg")

// Resource
imageView.load(R.drawable.image)

// File
imageView.load(File("/path/to/image.jpg"))

// And more...
```

Requests can be configured with an optional trailing lambda:

```kotlin
imageView.load("https://www.example.com/image.jpg") {
    crossfade(true)
    placeholder(R.drawable.image)
    transformations(CircleCropTransformation())
}
```

To get an image imperatively, use the `get` [suspend](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/basics.html) function:

```kotlin
val drawable = Coil.get("https://www.example.com/image.jpg")
```

Coil requires Java 8 bytecode. [Here's how to enable it](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/getting_started/#java-8). 

Check out Coil's [full documentation here](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/).

## Requirements

- AndroidX
- Min SDK 14+
- Compile SDK: 29+
- Java 8+

## R8 / Proguard

Coil is fully compatible with R8 out of the box and doesn't require adding any extra rules.

If you use Proguard, you may need to add rules for [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-core/jvm/resources/META-INF/proguard/coroutines.pro), [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/okhttp3.pro) and [Okio](https://github.com/square/okio/blob/master/okio/src/jvmMain/resources/META-INF/proguard/okio.pro).
