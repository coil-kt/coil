![Coil](logo.svg)

An image loading library for [Android](https://www.android.com/) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/). Coil is:

- **Fast**: Coil performs a number of optimizations including memory and disk caching, downsampling the image, automatically pausing/cancelling requests, and more.
- **Lightweight**: Coil only depends on Kotlin, Coroutines, and Okio and works seamlessly with [Google's R8](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code).
- **Easy to use**: Coil's API leverages Kotlin's language features for simplicity and minimal boilerplate.
- **Modern**: Coil is Kotlin-first and interoperates with modern libraries including Compose, Coroutines, Okio, Ktor, and OkHttp.

Coil is an acronym for: **Co**routine **I**mage **L**oader.

## Quick Start

Import the Compose library and a [networking library](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/network/):

```kotlin
implementation("io.coil-kt.coil3:coil-compose:3.0.0-rc02")
implementation("io.coil-kt.coil3:coil-network-okhttp:3.0.0-rc02")
```

To load an image, use the `AsyncImage` composable:

```kotlin
AsyncImage(
    model = "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    contentDescription = null,
)
```
