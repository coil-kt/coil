# Changelog

## [1.0.0-rc2] - September 3, 2020

- **This release requires Kotlin 1.4.0 or above.**
- All the changes present in [0.13.0](#0130---september-3-2020).
- Depend on the base Kotlin `stdlib` instead of `stdlib-jdk8`.

## [0.13.0] - September 3, 2020

- **Important**: Launch the Interceptor chain on the main thread by default. ([#513](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/513))
    - This largely restores the behaviour from `0.11.0` and below where the memory cache would be checked synchronously on the main thread.
    - To revert to using the same behaviour as `0.12.0` where the memory cache is checked on `ImageRequest.dispatcher`, set `ImageLoader.Builder.launchInterceptorChainOnMainThread(false)`.
    - See [`launchInterceptorChainOnMainThread`](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/api/coil-base/coil/-image-loader/-builder/launch-interceptor-chain-on-main-thread/) for more information.

---

- Fix: Fix potential memory leak if request is started on a `ViewTarget` in a detached fragment. ([#518](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/518))
- Fix: Use `ImageRequest.context` to load resource URIs. ([#517](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/517))
- Fix: Fix race condition that could cause subsequent requests to not be saved to the disk cache. ([#510](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/510))
- Fix: Use `blockCountLong` and `blockSizeLong` on API 18.

---

- Make `ImageLoaderFactory` a fun interface.
- Add `ImageLoader.Builder.addLastModifiedToFileCacheKey` which allows you to enable/disable adding the last modified timestamp to the memory cache key for an image loaded from a `File`.

---

- Update Kotlin to 1.4.0.
- Update Coroutines to 1.3.9.
- Update Okio to 2.8.0.

## [1.0.0-rc1] - August 18, 2020

- **This release requires Kotlin 1.4.0 or above.**
- Update Kotlin to 1.4.0 and enable [`-Xjvm-default=all`](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/07/kotlin-1-4-m3-generating-default-methods-in-interfaces/).
    - **[See here](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/getting_started/#java-8) for how to enable `-Xjvm-default=all` in your build file.**
    - This generates Java 8 default methods for default Kotlin interface methods.
- Remove all existing deprecated methods in 0.12.0.
- Update Coroutines to 1.3.9.

## [0.12.0] - August 18, 2020

- **Breaking**: `LoadRequest` and `GetRequest` have been replaced with `ImageRequest`:
    - `ImageLoader.execute(LoadRequest)` -> `ImageLoader.enqueue(ImageRequest)`
    - `ImageLoader.execute(GetRequest)` -> `ImageLoader.execute(ImageRequest)`
    - `ImageRequest` implements `equals`/`hashCode`.
- **Breaking**: A number of classes were renamed and/or changed package:
    - `coil.request.RequestResult` -> `coil.request.ImageResult`
    - `coil.request.RequestDisposable` -> `coil.request.Disposable`
    - `coil.bitmappool.BitmapPool` -> `coil.bitmap.BitmapPool`
    - `coil.DefaultRequestOptions` -> `coil.request.DefaultRequestOptions`
- **Breaking**: [`SparseIntArraySet`](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/blob/f52addd039f0195b66f93cb0f1cad59b0832f784/coil-base/src/main/java/coil/collection/SparseIntArraySet.kt) has been removed from the public API.
- **Breaking**: `TransitionTarget` no longer implements `ViewTarget`.
- **Breaking**: `ImageRequest.Listener.onSuccess`'s signature has changed to return an `ImageResult.Metadata` instead of just a `DataSource`.
- **Breaking**: Remove support for `LoadRequest.aliasKeys`. This API is better handled with direct read/write access to the memory cache.

---

- **Important**: Values in the memory cache are no longer resolved synchronously (if called from the main thread).
    - This change was also necessary to support executing `Interceptor`s on a background dispatcher.
    - This change also moves more work off the main thread, improving performance.
- **Important**: `Mappers` are now executed on a background dispatcher. As a side effect, automatic bitmap sampling is no longer **automatically** supported. To achieve the same effect, use the `MemoryCache.Key` of a previous request as the `placeholderMemoryCacheKey` of the subsequent request. [See here for an example](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/recipes/#using-a-memory-cache-key-as-a-placeholder).
    - The `placeholderMemoryCacheKey` API offers more freedom as you can "link" two image requests with different data (e.g. different URLs for small/large images).
- **Important**: Coil's `ImageView` extension functions have been moved from the `coil.api` package to the `coil` package.
    - Use find + replace to refactor `import coil.api.load` -> `import coil.load`. Unfortunately, it's not possible to use Kotlin's `ReplaceWith` functionality to replace imports.
- **Important**: Use standard crossfade if drawables are not the same image.
- **Important**: Prefer immutable bitmaps on API 24+.
- **Important**: `MeasuredMapper` has been deprecated in favour of the new `Interceptor` interface. See [here](https://gist.github.com/colinrtwhite/90267704091467451e46b21b95154299) for an example of how to convert a `MeasuredMapper` into an `Interceptor`.
    - `Interceptor` is a much less restrictive API that allows for a wider range of custom logic.
- **Important**: `ImageRequest.data` is now not null. If you create an `ImageRequest` without setting its data it will return `NullRequestData` as its data.

---

- **New**: Add support for direct read/write access to an `ImageLoader`'s `MemoryCache`. See [the docs](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/getting_started/#memory-cache) for more information.
- **New**: Add support for `Interceptor`s. See [the docs](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/image_pipeline/#interceptors) for more information. Coil's `Interceptor` design is heavily inspired by [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)'s!
- **New**: Add the ability to enable/disable bitmap pooling using `ImageLoader.Builder.bitmapPoolingEnabled`.
    - Bitmap pooling is most effective on API 23 and below, but may still be benificial on API 24 and up (by eagerly calling `Bitmap.recycle`).
- **New**: Support thread interruption while decoding.

---

- Fix parsing multiple segments in content-type header.
- Rework bitmap reference counting to be more robust.
- Fix WebP decoding on API < 19 devices.
- Expose FetchResult and DecodeResult in the EventListener API.

---

- Compile with SDK 30.
- Update Coroutines to 1.3.8.
- Update OkHttp to 3.12.12.
- Update Okio to 2.7.0.
- Update AndroidX dependencies:
    - `androidx.appcompat:appcompat-resources` -> 1.2.0
    - `androidx.core:core-ktx` -> 1.3.1

## [0.11.0] - May 14, 2020

- **Breaking**: **This version removes all existing deprecated functions.**
    - This enables removing Coil's `ContentProvider` so it doesn't run any code at app startup.
- **Breaking**: Convert `SparseIntArraySet.size` to a val. ([#380](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/380))
- **Breaking**: Move `Parameters.count()` to an extension function. ([#403](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/403))
- **Breaking**: Make `BitmapPool.maxSize` an Int. ([#404](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/404))

---

- **Important**: Make `ImageLoader.shutdown()` optional (similar to `OkHttpClient`). ([#385](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/385))

---

- Fix: Fix AGP 4.1 compatibility. ([#386](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/386))
- Fix: Fix measuring GONE views. ([#397](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/397))

---

- Reduce the default memory cache size to 20%. ([#390](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/390))
    - To restore the existing behaviour set `ImageLoaderBuilder.availableMemoryPercentage(0.25)` when creating your `ImageLoader`.
- Update Coroutines to 1.3.6.
- Update OkHttp to 3.12.11.

## [0.10.1] - April 26, 2020

- Fix OOM when decoding large PNGs on API 23 and below. ([#372](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/372)).
    - This disables decoding EXIF orientation for PNG files. PNG EXIF orientation is very rarely used and reading PNG EXIF data (even if it's empty) requires buffering the entire file into memory, which is bad for performance.
- Minor Java compatibility improvements to `SparseIntArraySet`.

---

- Update Okio to 2.6.0.

## [0.10.0] - April 20, 2020

### Highlights

- **This version deprecates most of the DSL API in favour of using the builders directly.** Here's what the change looks like:

    ```kotlin
    // 0.9.5 (old)
    val imageLoader = ImageLoader(context) {
        bitmapPoolPercentage(0.5)
        crossfade(true)
    }

    val disposable = imageLoader.load(context, "https://www.example.com/image.jpg") {
        target(imageView)
    }

    val drawable = imageLoader.get("https://www.example.com/image.jpg") {
        size(512, 512)
    }

    // 0.10.0 (new)
    val imageLoader = ImageLoader.Builder(context)
        .bitmapPoolPercentage(0.5)
        .crossfade(true)
        .build()

    val request = LoadRequest.Builder(context)
        .data("https://www.example.com/image.jpg")
        .target(imageView)
        .build()
    val disposable = imageLoader.execute(request)

    val request = GetRequest.Builder(context)
        .data("https://www.example.com/image.jpg")
        .size(512, 512)
        .build()
    val drawable = imageLoader.execute(request).drawable
    ```

    - If you're using the `io.coil-kt:coil` artifact, you can call `Coil.execute(request)` to execute the request with the singleton `ImageLoader`.

- **`ImageLoader`s now have a weak reference memory cache** that tracks weak references to images once they're evicted from the strong reference memory cache.
    - This means an image will always be returned from an `ImageLoader`'s memory cache if there's still a strong reference to it.
    - Generally, this should make the memory cache much more predictable and increase its hit rate.
    - This behaviour can be enabled/disabled with `ImageLoaderBuilder.trackWeakReferences`.

- Add a new artifact, **`io.coil-kt:coil-video`**, to decode specific frames from a video file. [Read more here](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/videos/).

- Add a new [EventListener](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/blob/master/coil-base/src/main/java/coil/EventListener.kt) API for tracking metrics.

- Add [ImageLoaderFactory](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/blob/master/coil-singleton/src/main/java/coil/ImageLoaderFactory.kt) which can be implemented by your `Application` to simplify singleton initialization.

## [0.9.1] - December 30, 2019

- Fix: Fix crash when calling `LoadRequestBuilder.crossfade(false)`.

## [0.9.0] - December 30, 2019

- **Breaking**: `Transformation.transform` now includes a `Size` parameter. This is to support transformations that change the size of the output `Bitmap` based on the size of the `Target`. Requests with transformations are now also exempt from [image sampling](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/getting_started/#image-sampling).
- **Breaking**: `Transformation`s are now applied to any type of `Drawable`. Before, `Transformation`s would be skipped if the input `Drawable` was not a `BitmapDrawable`. Now, `Drawable`s are rendered to a `Bitmap` before applying the `Transformation`s.
- **Breaking**: Passing `null` data to `ImageLoader.load` is now treated as an error and calls `Target.onError` and `Request.Listener.onError` with a `NullRequestDataException`. This change was made to support setting a `fallback` drawable if data is `null`. Previously the request was silently ignored.
- **Breaking**: `RequestDisposable.isDisposed` is now a `val`.

---

- **New**: Support for custom transitions. [See here for more info](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/transitions/). Transitions are marked as experimental as the API is incubating.
- **New**: Add `RequestDisposable.await` to support suspending while a `LoadRequest` is in progress.
- **New**: Support setting a `fallback` drawable when request data is null.
- **New**: Add `Precision`. This makes the size of the output `Drawable` exact while enabling scaling optimizations for targets that support scaling (e.g. `ImageViewTarget`). See [its documentation](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/blob/master/coil-base/src/main/java/coil/size/Precision.kt) for more information.
- **New**: Add `RequestBuilder.aliasKeys` to support matching multiple cache keys.

---

- Fix: Make RequestDisposable thread safe.
- Fix: `RoundedCornersTransformation` now crops to the size of the target then rounds the corners.
- Fix: `CircleCropTransformation` now crops from the center.
- Fix: Add several devices to the [hardware bitmap blacklist](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/blob/master/coil-base/src/main/java/coil/memory/HardwareBitmapService.kt).
- Fix: Preserve aspect ratio when converting a Drawable to a Bitmap.
- Fix: Fix possible memory cache miss with `Scale.FIT`.
- Fix: Ensure Parameters iteration order is deterministic.
- Fix: Defensive copy when creating Parameters and ComponentRegistry.
- Fix: Ensure RealBitmapPool's maxSize >= 0.
- Fix: Show the start drawable if CrossfadeDrawable is not animating or done.
- Fix: Adjust CrossfadeDrawable to account for children with undefined intrinsic size.
- Fix: Fix `MovieDrawable` not scaling properly.

---

- Update Kotlin to 1.3.61.
- Update Kotlin Coroutines to 1.3.3.
- Update Okio to 2.4.3.
- Update AndroidX dependencies:
    - `androidx.exifinterface:exifinterface` -> 1.1.0

## [0.8.0] - October 22, 2019

- **Breaking**: `SvgDrawable` has been removed. Instead, SVGs are now prerendered to `BitmapDrawable`s by `SvgDecoder`. This makes SVGs **significantly less expensive to render on the main thread**. Also `SvgDecoder` now requires a `Context` in its constructor.
- **Breaking**: `SparseIntArraySet` extension functions have moved to the `coil.extension` package.

---

- **New**: Support setting per-request network headers. [See here for more info](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/pull/120).
- **New**: Add new `Parameters` API to support passing custom data through the image pipeline.
- **New**: Support individual corner radii in RoundedCornersTransformation. Thanks @khatv911.
- **New**: Add `ImageView.clear()` to support proactively freeing resources.
- **New**: Support loading resources from other packages.
- **New**: Add `subtractPadding` attribute to ViewSizeResolver to enable/disable subtracting a view's padding when measuring.
- **New**: Improve HttpUrlFetcher MIME type detection.
- **New**: Add Animatable2Compat support to MovieDrawable and CrossfadeDrawable.
- **New**: Add `RequestBuilder<*>.repeatCount` to set the repeat count for a GIF.
- **New**: Add BitmapPool creation to the public API.
- **New**: Annotate Request.Listener methods with `@MainThread`.

---

- Update OkHttp to 3.12.6.
- Update Okio to 2.4.1.
- Change `appcompat-resources` from `compileOnly` to `implementation` for `coil-base`.

## [0.7.0] - September 8, 2019
- **Breaking**: `ImageLoaderBuilder.okHttpClient(OkHttpClient.Builder.() -> Unit)` is now `ImageLoaderBuilder.okHttpClient(() -> OkHttpClient)`. The initializer is also now called lazily on a background thread. **If you set a custom `OkHttpClient` you must set `OkHttpClient.cache` to enable disk caching.** If you don't set a custom `OkHttpClient`, Coil will create the default `OkHttpClient` which has disk caching enabled. The default Coil cache can be created using `CoilUtils.createDefaultCache(context)`. e.g.:

```kotlin
val imageLoader = ImageLoader(context) {
    okHttpClient {
        OkHttpClient.Builder()
            .cache(CoilUtils.createDefaultCache(context))
            .build()
    }
}
```

- **Breaking**: `Fetcher.key` no longer has a default implementation.
- **Breaking**: Previously, only the first applicable `Mapper` would be called. Now, all applicable `Mapper`s will be called. No API changes.
- **Breaking**: Minor named parameter renaming: `url` -> `uri`, `factory` -> `initializer`.

---

- **New**: `coil-svg` artifact, which has an `SvgDecoder` that supports automatically decoding SVGs. Powered by [AndroidSVG](https://github.com/BigBadaboom/androidsvg). Thanks @rharter.
- **New**: `load(String)` and `get(String)` now accept any of the supported Uri schemes. e.g. You can now do `imageView.load("file:///path/to/file.jpg")`.
- **New**: Refactor ImageLoader to use `Call.Factory` instead of `OkHttpClient`. This allows lazy initialization of the networking resources using `ImageLoaderBuilder.okHttpClient { OkHttpClient() }`. Thanks @ZacSweers.
- **New**: `RequestBuilder.decoder` to explicitly set the decoder for a request.
- **New**: `ImageLoaderBuilder.allowHardware` to enable/disable hardware bitmaps by default for an ImageLoader.
- **New**: Support software rendering in ImageDecoderDecoder.
