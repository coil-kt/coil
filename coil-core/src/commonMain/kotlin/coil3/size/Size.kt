/**
 * Represents the target size of an image request.
 *
 * Each [Size] is composed of two [Dimension]s, [width] and [height]. Each dimension determines
 * by how much the source image should be scaled. A [Dimension] can either be a fixed pixel
 * value or [Dimension.Undefined]. Examples:
 *
 * - Given `Size(400, 600)`, the image should be loaded to fit/fill a width of 400 pixels and a
 *   height of 600 pixels.
 * - Given `Size(400, Dimension.Undefined)`, the image should be loaded to fit/fill a width of 400
 *   pixels.
 * - Given `Size(Dimension.Undefined, Dimension.Undefined)`, the image should not be scaled to
 *   fit/fill either width or height. i.e. it will be loaded at its original width/height.
 *
